# HoloBundle - A GUI for fibre bundle inline holographic microscopy in Python

HoloBundle is developed at [Mike Hughes' lab'](https://research.kent.ac.uk/applied-optics/hughes)  
in the [Applied Optics Group](https://research.kent.ac.uk/applied-optics/), School of Physics & Astronomy, 
University of Kent.

HoloBundle is built on [CAS](https://www.github.com/mikehugheskent/cas),  [PyFibreBundle](https://www.github.com/mikehugheskent/pyfibrebundle) and [PyHoloscope](https://www.github.com/mikehugheskent/pyholoscope). 
It is not currently fully documented or tested outside of our 
specific applications and may be difficult to make sense of.

If you are looking for a documented package for holographic microscopy processing to build you own
processing pipeline/GUI around, take a look at [PyHoloscope](https://www.github.com/mikehugheskent/pyholoscope).  

Or for fibre bundle imaging systems in general [PyFibreBundle](https://www.github.com/mikehugheskent/pyfibrebundle).
